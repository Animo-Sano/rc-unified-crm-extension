# Setup and installation

## Installing the browser plugin

**Google Chrome**

The Unified CRM extension was initially architected for Google Chrome, and is therefore installed easily from the [Google Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ringcentral-crm-extension/kkhkjhafgdlihndcbnebljipgkandkhh). 

**Microsoft Edge**

Microsoft Edge supports most Chrome extensions. To install them, however, you will need to [make configuration changes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/add-turn-off-or-remove-extensions-in-microsoft-edge-9c0ec68c-2fbc-2f2c-9ff0-bdc76f46b026) to Edge. In summary:

1. In Microsoft Edge, navigate to the Chrome Web Store. 
2. Select "Allow extensions from other stores" in the banner at the top of the page, then select "Allow" to confirm.
3. Navigate to the [Unified CRM extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ringcentral-crm-extension/kkhkjhafgdlihndcbnebljipgkandkhh) and select "Add to Chrome."
4. Follow any additional prompts to complete the installation process. 

## Managing software updates

Updates to the Unified CRM extension are installed automatically by Chrome and Edge when you restart your browser. You can see what version of the Unified CRM extension is currently installed by navigating to the "Manage extensions" area of your browser, finding the Unified CRM extension in your list of installed plugins, and clicking "Show details." On the resulting page you can see the currently installed version. 

To ensure you are actively running the most recent version, please restart your browser.
