## Installing the browser plugin

**Google Chrome**

The Unified CRM extension was initially architected for Google Chrome, and is therefore installed easily from the [Google Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ringcentral-crm-extension/kkhkjhafgdlihndcbnebljipgkandkhh). Click the "Add to Chrome" button to install the extension instantly. Then, consult the instructions specific to your CRM.

**Microsoft Edge**

Microsoft Edge supports most Chrome extensions. To install them, however, you will need to [make configuration changes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/add-turn-off-or-remove-extensions-in-microsoft-edge-9c0ec68c-2fbc-2f2c-9ff0-bdc76f46b026) to Edge. In summary:

1. In Microsoft Edge, navigate to the Chrome Web Store. 
2. Select "Allow extensions from other stores" in the banner at the top of the page, then select "Allow" to confirm.
3. Navigate to the [Unified CRM extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ringcentral-crm-extension/kkhkjhafgdlihndcbnebljipgkandkhh) and select "Add to Chrome."
4. Follow any additional prompts to complete the installation process. 

## Connecting to your CRM

The process of connecting the Unified CRM extension to your CRM is more or less the same at a high-level.

2. While viewing a page in your CRM, open up the CTI.
3. Open the "More" tab and select "Settings."
4. Scroll down to find your CRM, and click the "Connect" button.

On the resulting page you can see the currently installed version. 

To ensure you are actively running the most recent version, please restart your browser.
