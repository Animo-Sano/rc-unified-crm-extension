# Accessing the extension to make calls

The Unified CRM extension makes available to users a fully-functional web phone for placing and receiving calls, as well as recording notes and call dispositions related to those calls -- not to mention numerous other features. The web phone can be accessed in one of two ways.

## Click the quick access button

When logged into and viewing your CRM, a blue "R" handle/button will appear in the lower-righthand corner of your browser window. Hovering over it will show a dialer icon. Click the dialer icon to open the dialer window and bring it to the foreground.

*Pro tip: if the blue handle obscures page content, or if you wish to hide it for other reasons, you may turn this off using an advanced configuration parameter.*

## Click "RingCentral CRM Extension" from the extensions menu

You can open the Unified CRM extension dialer by finding the extension in your list of installed extensions and clicking "RingCentral CRM Extension."

*Pro tip: if you need to access the extension often, you can "pin" the extension to your location bar so that it is more readily available.*
