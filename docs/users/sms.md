# Sending SMS

The Unified CRM extension also has the ability to send and receive SMS messages. You can access this functionality from the Messages tab and works more or less like your phone. Click on the conversation you want to view, and then send messages to that individual or group. 

## SMS templates

Engaging with communications from customers can be overwhelming, and responding to the same questions individually can be taxing. SMS templates allow you to compose responses to common inquiries ahead of time. Then when it comes time to author a message, rather than composing your response manually, select from one of your pre-written responses, populate the message into the messaging box, make any small edits you need, and then click send.

**Importing and exporting SMS templates**

Right now, all pre-written SMS messages are stored locally in your browser. But one can share their responses with their colleagues by exporting their templates to a file which is downloaded automatically, and then having their coworkers import that file into their instance of the Unified CRM extension.

*Warning: when importing templates all previous templates will be erased. So if you have made changes, be sure to export them or save them somewhere so that those changes can be preserved.*

**Limitations**

* SMS templates are stored locally in your browser, and are not shared with others in your organization or account.
