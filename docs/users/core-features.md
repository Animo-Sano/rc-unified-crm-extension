# Using the Unified CRM extension

## Accessing the extension to make calls

The Unified CRM extension makes available to users a fully-functional web phone for placing and receiving calls, as well as recording notes and call dispositions related to those calls -- not to mention numerous other features. The web phone can be accessed in one of two ways.

### Click the quick access button

When logged into and viewing your CRM, a blue "R" handle/button will appear in the lower-righthand corner of your browser window. Hovering over it will show a dialer icon. Click the dialer icon to open the dialer window and bring it to the foreground.

*Pro tip: if the blue handle obscures page content, or if you wish to hide it for other reasons, you may turn this off using an advanced configuration parameter.*

### Click "RingCentral CRM Extension" from the extensions menu

You can open the Unified CRM extension dialer by finding the extension in your list of installed extensions and clicking "RingCentral CRM Extension."

*Pro tip: if you need to access the extension often, you can "pin" the extension to your location bar so that it is more readily available.*

## Making and receiving calls

It is hard to believe this needs to be documented at all. As soon as you login to your RingCentral account via the extension when it is first loaded and initialized, you will be able to make and receive calls. 

When you receive a call, you will hear a ringing sound. Bring the extension to the foreground and click "Answer" to begin the call.

To place a call, bring the extension to the foreground, open up the dialer, and dial the phone number. It is as simple as that. 

## Click-to-dial

When using your CRM, all phone numbers in your CRM will become clickable, allowing you to easily initiate a call with that phone number, or send an SMS message to that phone number. This helps users more quickly and easily engage with contacts, leads, candidates and people whom your CRM tracks.

### Call-pop

If this feature is enabled, when you receive a phone call the Unified CRM extension will open a browser tab to the contact record of the person calling you. That way when you answer the call, you will have all pertinent information about them at your fingertips, helping you to create a personalized experience for your customer. 

*Pro tip: call-pop functionality can easily be disabled via Settings accessed via the More menu.* 

## Presence and status

Using the embedded phone provided by the Unified CRM extension one can easily set their presence and/or status and instantly have that synced across the network. Similarly, your presence status will always be reflected in your embedded dialer as it changes via mechanisms outside of the extension. 

There are two ways to change your status:

* Click the presence indicator in the upper-left corner of the embedded dialer

* Navigate to the Settings page under the more menu and modify it from there

## Sending SMS

The Unified CRM extension also has the ability to send and receive SMS messages. You can access this functionality from the Messages tab and works more or less like your phone. Click on the conversation you want to view, and then send messages to that individual or group. 

### SMS templates

Engaging with communications from customers can be overwhelming, and responding to the same questions individually can be taxing. SMS templates allow you to compose responses to common inquiries ahead of time. Then when it comes time to author a message, rather than composing your response manually, select from one of your pre-written responses, populate the message into the messaging box, make any small edits you need, and then click send.

**Importing and exporting SMS templates**

Right now, all pre-written SMS messages are stored locally in your browser. But one can share their responses with their colleagues by exporting their templates to a file which is downloaded automatically, and then having their coworkers import that file into their instance of the Unified CRM extension.

*Warning: when importing templates all previous templates will be erased. So if you have made changes, be sure to export them or save them somewhere so that those changes can be preserved.*

**Limitations**

* SMS templates are stored locally in your browser, and are not shared with others in your organization or account.
